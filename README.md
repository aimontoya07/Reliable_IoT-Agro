# Reliable_Iot-Agro
We introduces an IoT-based SF application with particular attention to data cleansing by providing Fog-based data reliability using data analysis to recognize and correct failures in real and raw collected farming data.

Our contributions are:
• An ML algorithm and Interpolation technique-based approach to automatically provide data reliability for decision making supported on Fog-IoT-Cloud-based SF application.
• An ML-based mechanism for outlier detection in IoT-based Smart Farming data collection.
• An interpolation-based mechanism for replacing the outliers detected with inferred data.
• A case study involving real data collected in a network based on a Fog-IoT-Cloud and deployed in a Colombian Smart Coffee Farm.
